# schwarzlist

A very simple script checking the list of WireGuard .conf files against the database of known VPN IP ranges to check if your server has already been schwarzlisted for good.

Edit the script for you needs if needed, it's very short.

The only unusual utility it needs is **grepcidr**, install it from your distro's repos.
